# Fruition Labyrinth Game (Borland C++)

This is a class project I made in 2013 using only the graphing tool of Turbo C.
It's a labyrinth game that uses elements such as switches and doors to add a twist to the difficulty, 
which makes it a true puzzle game. I created my sprites based on retro-games you might identify.

# Executing

To execute the game launch 'labyrint.bat' from the root folder, DOSBOX will take care of things.

# Source File

I have included my 'source file', and it is quite messy! But it worked for me. :)
